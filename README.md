# dailyplanner-practice

Do you have problems scheduling your day? Want something that makes it everso, ittily, bittily easier to do? Then this is a planner for you.

Simple design, limited styling. Date and time displayed through dayjs API.

Jquery based events cause forms to change color based on time of day. If the hour has passed, the form box will be gray, if it is the current time, the box will be yellow, if it is a future time, the boxes should be green.

Schedule features run on military time, display in pedestrian time.

On click saving feature stores user schedule in local storage and recalls it using a dope object loop.
